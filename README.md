# jekyll-minimag

A work in progress…

A Jekyll site based on the minima theme (version 2.5.1). (The dependence on the gem theme has been overridden, so updates to minima will have no effect on minimag.)

One departure of minimag from minima is the implementation of a “card” presentation, including an illustration, for each post’s entry on posts-listing pages.

The initial construction of this site follows Bill Raymond’s YouTube video “[Draft training - Run GitHub Pages in a Docker container](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zCZhPjzlc0&lc=Ugw9B54_UzDEPIQFP_N4AaABAg),” which was a draft and unlisted as of April 2, 2023.
